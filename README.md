# Izumi-chan
An anime website that gives you the anime you desire along with a quote. 

Izumi-Chan is a personal project of mine that I want to create and put out onto the internet for other people to use. 
The purpose of this website is to give you the anime that you look up, along with information about the show, such as the synopsis, and will also display
a quote from a random character of the show.

This project is being made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript and is my first time fully experimenting with APIs. 
This website will be powered by two APIS, and that is Jikan, which is an anime database API that parses the website MyAnimeList to make the API. 
Currently I am using the Version 3 of the website but will eventually move to level 4. 

This website is also using the Anime-Chan API to over 10,000 quotes from various anime shows and characters. This is what I will use to give the
output of quotes. 

Currently, Izumi-Chan is in Beta, only putting out the name of the shows, images, and synopsis. However, currently in the console log it is outputting quotes and even more 
information regarding the shows.
